"O123n June 7, 2023, at 3:45 AM, I met 2 friends who told me about their 4 new projects. We decided to meet again in 6 hours at a cafe located at 10 Pushkin Street. I ordered coffee and 8 pastries, and then shared with them a remarkable book I had read recently. One of my friends told a joke involving 5 penguins, and we all laughed until 9 in the morning. After that, we went our separate ways, and I returned home to continue working on my project, which had to be completed by 12:34 PM."
